In "estimate_accuracy.R" and "estimate_accuracy2.R",  we used poplar and wheat data published by Renaud Rincent et al (https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200760).  

In "estimate_accuracy5.R", we used the wheat data published by Zachary Winn et al (https://doi.org/10.1002/ppj2.20084).

In "estimate_accuracy4.R", we used the wheat data published by Margaret Krause et al (https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200856). 

Plots were made in "plot.R" and "plot2.R". Supplement table was made in "plot.R".
